What is Apache?An open source Web ServerRuns on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS

It is considered very secure, fast and reliable
Apache supports several server side scripting languagesMost notably PHP

Apache also supports a variety of mods

Default port is 80 for http and 443 for https 



Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs)
What is an MPM?MPMs are used to bind to network ports, accept requests, anddispatch child processes to handle the requests

Since apache is modular it comes with multiple MPM options, theseare also based on the capability of the operating system
See https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mpm.html for moredetail 



apache2
The package and service name on Debian for apache is apache2
Configuration files by default are in:/etc/apache2/

All configuration files are plain text files
Log files are located in /var/log/apache2/ by defaultaccess_log - contains information about people who access yourwebsite
error_log - contains error information about failed attempts toaccess your website 




apache2.conf
By default the document root is in /var/www.htmlDocumentRoot /var/www/html - in apache2.conf

By default apache will look for an index.html page to display whenthe user navigates to the root of your website
Apache by default blocks all files (includes sub directories):

# Block all by default<Directory />AllowOverride noneRequireall denied</Directory> 



apache2.conf (continued)
You have to allow individual directories:

<Directory "/var/www/html">Options Indexes FollowSymLinksAllowOverride NoneRequireall granted</Directory>
You can also block specific files:

<Files ".ht*">Requireall denied</Files> 



apache2.conf (continued)
You can specify additional optional configuration files with theIncludeOptional

IncludeOptional sites-available/*.conf
Custom error Documents

ErrorDocument404 /missing.html 



vhosts (sites)
What are vhosts?A vhost is a virtual host, this allows you to host multiplewebsites on the same serverfor example you can host api.example.com andwww.example.com using the same server
you can even host different domains like test.com andnotatest.com

Each vhost will have a separate configuration, and are usuallylocated in different directories 




vhost (site) config
<VirtualHost *:80>ServerName example2.comDocumentRoot /var/www/example2.com/html/ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error_log_ex2CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access_log_ex1 common</VirtualHost><VirtualHost *:80>ServerName example1.comDocumentRoot /var/www/example1.com/html/ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error_log_ex1CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access_log_ex1 common</VirtualHost> 



vhost (site) config continued
<Directory /var/www/example2.com/html/>Requireall granted</Directory> 



Starting and Stopping
You can use systemd tools to start and stop the apache serversystemctl start apache2 - start the service now
systemctl enable apache2 - have the service start at systemstartup
systemctl stop apache2 - stop the service
systemctl restart apache2 - restart the service
systemctl reload apache2 - reload is supported by apache2,this means it will reload the configuration without stopping theserver 




apachectl
Apache also comes with its own tool called apachectl
Command	Description
apachectl start	Start the server
apachectl stop	Stop the server
apachectl restart	Restart the server
apachectl configtest	Test the syntax of the configuration
apachectl status	Display a brief status of the server
apachectl fullstsatus	Display full status report from mod_status 



a2enmod and a2dismod
Apache on debian also comes with its own tool forenabling/disabling modulesa2enmod {module} and a2dismod {module}
Command	Description
a2enmod ssl	Enable the ssl module on apache2 by creatingsymlinks from mods-available in mods-enabled
a2dismod ssl	Disable the ssl module on apache2 by removingsymlinks from mods-enabled 



a2ensite and a2dissite
Apache on debian also comes with its own tool forenabling/disabling sites(vhosts)a2ensite {site conf} and a2dissite {site conf}
Command	Description
a2ensiteiacobacci.com.conf	Enable the iacobacci.com.conf site on apache2by creating symlinks from sites-available insites-enabled
a2dissiteiacobacci.com.conf	Disable the iacobacci.com.conf module onapache2 by removing symlinks from sites-enabled 



a2enconf and a2disconf
Apache on debian also comes with its own tool forenabling/disabling specific configurationsa2enconf {conf} and a2enconf {conf}
Command	Description
a2enconf security.conf	Enable the security.conf site on apache2by creating symlinks from conf-available in conf-enabled
a2disconf security.conf	Disable the security.conf module onapache2 by removing symlinks fromconf-enabled 



SSL/TLS Support
Apache supports SSL/TLS and HTTPS
First you must enable the SSL mod using apta2enmod ssl

Next you'll need to obtain a certificate
Then configure you Protocol and Cipher Suites 



default-ssl.conf and ssl.conf
Setting a certificate (more on getting one later):

SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/iacobacci.ca/fullchain.pemSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/iacobacci.ca/privkey.pem
Set SSL ciphers

SSLProtocolall -SSLv3SSLCipherSuite EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDHSSLHonorCipherOrderon 



Certificates
There are 3 ways to get certificatesGenerate your own, however this won't be a valid verifiablecertificate, and browsers will warn you the site is insecure
Purchase a certificate
Use a Let's Encrypt certificate

Remember just like SSH, the private certificate MUST remainsecure and private 



Let's Encrypt
Let's encrypt provides free HTTPS certificates
They have to be renewed about every 3 months
There are some limitations on how many certificates each accountand domain can have
Let's Encrypt does not verify the owner of the certificate outside ofthe domain
To get a certificate through Let's Encrypt using the program certbot is highly recommendedhttps://certbot.eff.org/
yum install certbot 




HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is the newest version of HTTPit is a binary protocol rather then plain text (HTTP/1.1)
HTTP/2 support multiple streams simultaneously

Apache has mod_http2 in order to implement HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is not compatible with all MPMs so be careful with yourconfiguration! 



PHP
What is PHP?PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a server side scripting language
These script are executed generally to produce dynamic contentfor a website
PHP supports many databases (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, DB2,Generic ODBC)
Support OOP and structural programming 




Install and Using PHP
In order to install PHP apt install php php-mysql libapache2-mod-php
The php packages comes with the required configuration forapache to read php files. An apache reload will be required.
Once PHP is operation you can then create a script to see yourPHP info

<?phpphpinfo();?> 



PHP at runtime
When a PHP file is navigated to, apache will call PHP to run thescriptSince PHP is an interpretive language it will read the file andinterpret with each run (no compilation required)

The script will run as the user the apache server is running as 



php.ini
The PHP configuration file is located in /etc/php/{version}/{application}/php.ini
Some of the common configuration changes you might want to editinclude:upload directory
global variables
max uploading size
max script execution time 




php.ini (continued)
error_reportingDefault Value: E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
Development Value: E_ALL | E_STRICT
Production Value: E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED

html_errorsDefault Value: On
Development Value: On
Production value: Off 




php.ini (continued)

log_errorsDefault Value: Off
Development Value: On
Production Value: On


display_errorsDefault Value: On
Development Value: On
Production Value: Off
Example, display_errors = On 




Firewall
By default Linux comes with a firewall called iptablesiptables has a lot of options:Including when packets will be analyzed (ex. prerouting,postrouting, input, output, forward)
how to filter them and what do to with them


However all the options of iptables makes it complicated to use soinstead we use a command called firewalld and firewall-cmd toconfigure the basicsfirewalld must be installed with apt install firewalld 




firewall-cmdCommand	Description
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp	Open TCP port 80permanently
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https	Open port(s) for httpspermanently
firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=443/tcp	Closes TCP port 443permanently
firewall-cmd --reload	Reload the firewallconfiguration 




MySQL & MariaDB
What is MySQL?MySQL is an open source relational database managementsystem
It uses a multithreaded design approach
MySQL was purchased by Oracle, and since it wastrademarked it was then forked (meaning the code was takento create a new project)
The MySQL fork is called MariaDB
In our labs we are going to use MariaDB 




Why use a RDBMS?
Historically we used flat files to store dataFlat files are simply text files with forced column widths

Searching through a flat file was particularly slow, especiallyreading a whole file to process the data
So relational databases were created for speed and efficiencyRelationally databases increase efficiency through properlyuser defined tables, indexed by primary keys
Tables can be linked together with foreign keys 




Why use MySQL/MariaDB?
It has superior performance when compared to other opensourceRDBMS like PostgreSQL and SQLite
It is well supported by its open source community
No license feesProprietary DB license fees are usually substantial (like DB2,Oracle, or MSSQL)

It is lightweight while offering a full feature set 



What is SQL?
SQL is a common standard used by most relational databases
It is used to create, update and retrieve information from arelational database
SQL has a very particular syntax, however most relationaldatabase add a few extra features that are non-standardFor example: MySQL has REPLACE

Commonly referred to as Structured Query Language 



SQL
SQL is declarative - you describe what you want and thedatabase will determine how to do it
SQL is interactive - you issue SQL commands directly to yourdatabase management system and it displays the results
SQL can also be embeded - you can embed SQL statements intoa scripting or programming language like BASH, PHP or Java
SQL is standardized - no one owns it, but it is a standard that isdefined by an international standards working group 




What makes up a RDBMS?
A database is generally made up of multiple schemas
Schemas contain multiple tablesNote: In MySQL a database and schema are the same bothcontain tables

A table contains columns and rows (records) 



Columns
Each column represents a specific attribute or property of thetable's entity type
Each column has a domain (set of constraints) that includerestrictions on a value's datatype, length, range, uniqueness,specific values and nullability (can be null or not)
Entries in columns are single valued
Order of columns is unimportant
Each column has a name that ID's it uniquely within a table
Column definitions rarely change 



Rows (Records)
Each row describes an entity
Each column in the row contains a value based on the columnconstraints for the entity
In a properly designed database, no 2 rows should be the same
Each row should be identified by a unique primary key
Rows frequently change
The cross-section of columns and rows create FieldsFields are a single value! 




Primary Key - Introduction
Each table should have exactly one primary key
Each record must have a unique primary key ID
A primary key can be made up of a single column or multiplecolumns
A primary key cannot be null 



mariadb
In order to install MariaDB you'll need to run apt install mariadb-client, mariadb-server
The service name will still be mariadb
The service will call the command mysqld
The client is the mysql command
Generally speaking we don't want to open the database toexternal access so make sure the database is behind some kindof firewall whether external or iptables 



Securing MySQL
Run the command mysql_secure_installation to be prompted tosecure your database installationSet root passwordNot to be confused with the system root password, MySQLhas it's own root user

Remove Anonymous users
Disallow root login remotely
Remove Test Database 




MySQL shell
You must log into the MySQL shell to:Create Databases/Schemas
Create Users
Grant/Revoke privileges
Create/Update/Drop tables
Insert/Update/Delete records
Query records for information 




Command: mysqlCommand	Description
mysql	Login to the database at localhoston the default port as root with nopassword
mysql -u bob -p"drowssap"	Login to the local database as userbob with the password drowssap
mysql -u bob -p"drowssap"--host=php.scweb.ca --port=3306	Login to the MySQL server onphp.scweb.ca on port 3306 




Creating Databases/Schemas
Recall Databases and Schemas are the same in MySQL
In order to create a database we would use:

CREATE DATABASE mit416;
In CLI client:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE mit416;



Creating Users
To create the user student available on localhost with thepassword of test1

CREATE USER 'student'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
You can use different hosts and a wildcard to allow connections

/* Allow users from any host */CREATE USER 'student'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';/* Allow users from any host that ends with scweb.ca */CREATE USER 'student'@'%.scweb.ca' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';/* Allow users from any IP that starts with 192.168 */CREATE USER 'student'@'192.168.%.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';



Granting Privileges
Now that we've created users and databases we want to grantprivileges to those users

/* Grant all privileges to student for the database mit416 and its tables */GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mit416.* to student@localhost/* Grant read privileges to student on exampledb */GRANT SELECT ON exampledb.* to student@localhost
Granting all permissions on a database provides all privileges tofunctions and tables
More info here: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/grant/ 



Viewing Users
To view users on a MySQL database

SELECT user,host,password FROM mysql.user;
MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT user,host,password FROM mysql.user where user='fiacobacci';+------------+------+-------------------------------------------+| user | host | password |+------------+------+-------------------------------------------+| fiacobacci | % | *451559073555104A841F0DEFEBCE26CEC5617D7F |+------------+------+-------------------------------------------+1 row in set (0.001 sec)



Viewing Privileges
To view privileges on a MySQL database

SHOW GRANTS FOR fiacobacci@localhost
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW GRANTS FOR fiacobacci;+------------------------------------------------------------+| Grants for fiac |+------------------------------------------------------------+| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'fiacobacci'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*451559073555104A841F0DEFEBCE26CEC5617D7F' || GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES,EXECUTE, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EVENT, TRIGGER ON `fiacobaccidb`.* TO 'fiacobacci'@'%' |+------------------------------------------------------------+




Creating Tables
Creating and employee table

CREATE TABLE employee( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, firstname VARCHAR(20), lastname VARCHAR(20), department VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (id));
Remove tables

DROP TABLE employee; 



Inserting/Updating/Deleting Records
You can Create records using INSERT INTO, modify them with UPDATE and remove them with DELETE FROM

/* Create a record */INSERT INTO employee VALUES (DEFAULT,"Franco", "Iacobacci", "Networking");/* Modify the record */UPDATE employee SET department="IT" WHERE id=1;/* Delete the record */DELETE FROM employee WHERE id=1;




Viewing data from a Database
In order to view data you can use SELECT

/* Select all records from employee */SELECT * FROM employee/* Select all records with the first name Bob */SELECT * FROM employee WHERE firstname='Bob'/* Select all records and order by the ID */SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY id




Exporting a MySQL Database
In order to export a MySQL database you can run the followingcommand
mysqldump -u username -p"password" database_name > File.sql
Replace username, password and database_name with yourMySQL username, password and database name. FILE.sql nowholds a backup of your database. 



Resetting the root password

Don't forget your root password!!!!!

	OK in case you do:Stop the mysqld service
	Run mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
	Login to mysql shell using mysql
	Update forgotten password using (see code below)
	Restart service
	

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Content Management System
What is a Content Management System (CMS)?An application:That supports creation and modification of digital content
Often used to support multiple users working in acollaborative environment
That supports the management of the content of Web PagesWeb Content can include, text embedded graphics, photos,videos, audio, maps, program code 





Why use a CMS?
CMS's take the modification of a website content out of developershands and puts it in the hands of usersImagine owning a store and having to hire a developer to updateinventory every day, that would be expensive

CMS's also allows users to follow templates
Usually has built in analytics or an extension for analytics
Usually is secure, or is more thoroughly tested due to the massusage 


What makes up a CMS?
Typically CMS's have 2 major componentsA Content Management Application (CMA)The CMA is the front-end user interface that allows a user,even with limited expertise to add, modify and removecontent from a website without intervention from awebmaster or developer

A Content Delivery Application (CDA)The CDA is the back end which delivers the content to thecontent consumers (ex. customers) 




WordPress
WordPress is an open source CMSCoded with PHP and supports MySQL or MariaDB
A good starting point to develop websites that need constantupdating
Can be extended with thousands of plugins
WordPress was used by about 40% of the top 10 millionwebsites as of 2021Up from 27.5% in 2017 




WordPress (continued)
Some downsides to WordPress:WordPress is a huge, complicated application
There are constant security updates that must be applied
WordPress is a large attack target due to its popularity
Too many choices for plugins and themes. It can be difficult tochoose the best quality plugins and themes.
Plugins are not as reliable or secure as the base application 



How to setup WordPress
	Since we already have Apache setupDownload the latest version using wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
	Extract the downloaded WordPress file to the hosted folderusing tar xzvf latest.tar.gz
	Create a database in MariaDB for WordPress (ex. WordPress)
	Create an user account in MariaDB and give permission to yourDatabase 
	


How to setup WordPress continued
	./wordpress/wp-config-sample.php to ./wordpress/wp-config.php
	Update the wp-config.php file with the correct values in DatabaseName, Database User, and Database Password:
define('DB_NAME', "WordPress");define('DB_USER', "wpuser");define('DB_PASSWORD', "password"); 


How to setup WordPress continued
	Create 2 folders called uploads and cache
./wordpress/wp-content/uploads./wordpress/wp-content/cache
	Change the owner of the 2 directories created to apache using
chown apache:apache ./wordpress/wp-content/uploadschown apache:apache ./wordpress/wp-content/cache
	Restart Apache. 


PHPMyAdmin
PHPMyAdmin is an opensource software tool written in PHP
It is intended to handle administration of a MySQL or MariaDBserver through a web application
It allows you to execute SQL statements as client to a MySQL orMariaDB server
Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns,relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc.)
It can be significantly slower then command line to execute SQLstatements, however has an efficient interface from a usage standpoint 


Installing PHPMyAdmin
	Copy the latest link from https://www.phpmyadmin.net/
	Use wget to download the package
	Extract the zip file using unzip to the location where it will behosted by apache (ex. the DocumentRoot of a vhost)

When installing PHPMyAdmin to a server consider adding it to aserver that is only internally accessible as it is databasemanagement softwareIf there is a bug that causes unauthorized access, you'll want tominimize the risk 



Alternative CMS: Joomla
Can be found here: https://www.joomla.org/
Joomla is also PHP based
It's coded to work with MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, SQLite
It has search engine optimization
It supports extensions similar to WordPress
Represents about 3% of the websites on the internet 


Alternative CMS: concrete5
Can be found at: https://www.concrete5.org/
concrete5 is also coded in PHP
Supports MySQL, and MariaDB
It supports versioning for every pageMeaning it's easy to rollback if needed

Supports a drag and drop style of website creation 


Alternative CMS: Drupal
Can be found at: https://www.concrete5.org/
Drupal is also coded in PHP
Supports MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, SQLite, Oracle
Drupal usually requires some developer intervention at first,however in the long term scales better then a WordPress webapplication
Drupal generally provides a more robust but complex interface 


Other languages
So far we've talked about CMS's that are all coded in PHP
However there are CMS's coded for other types of web servers likeJava or node.js based servers
There are even hosted only CMS's like Wix, which can only be usedin the cloud 


Alternative CMS: Wix
Can be found: https://www.wix.com/
Wix cannot be internally hosted, you must host it on Wix Servers
Very user friendly interface to create website
Has advanced feature set for those who require a more robustsolution 


Alternative CMS: ghost.js
Can be found at: https://ghost.org/
ghost.js is coded with node.js
It has some integrations
It is designed to be a blogging platform
Search Engine Optimization and social features are built in 


Other Language Servers
Recall from our Apache Web Server lesson, Apache will bind to theport and listen for requests.
Then using a PHP mod apache will be able to handle PHP pages bycalling PHP as a child to apache
Node.js on the other hand will bind to the port itself and node.jswill handle the Web Requests
Java operates similar to node.js in that it also binds to the port andhandles the web requests
Since both Java and node.js are less tested and robust they aremore prone to bugs 


Apache Reverse Proxies
If you need to host a less secure server, but don't want it directlyfront facing, you can use Apache to host a reverse proxy
OR if you need more then one type of server hosted on the samemachine, for example both a Java and node.js server
First you would setup your other server to run on a different port,usually above 1024 so it doesn't require root (ex. 50080)
Then you'll configure a vhost on apache to point to the otherserver
You can then setup multiple reverse proxies on the same machine ifrequired 


Apache Reverse Proxies (continued)
The VirtualHost config should look like:
<VirtualHost *:80>ServerName java.example.comProxyPreserveHostOnProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:50080/ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:50080/</VirtualHost>
Keep in mind the destination server doesn't have to be localhost, itcould be located anywhere the server can reach
