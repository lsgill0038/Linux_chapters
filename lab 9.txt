3.	Within the vhost directory above create a directory {lastname}.com (ex iacobacci.com), this will be our document root. Create a small index.html file containing your student number. 
a.	Note: Ensure the user and group that are running apache have the ability to read this file
ANS: mkdir /var/vhost/lastname.com
Vim /var/vhost/lastname.com/index.html
<html>
<head>
<title> student number </title>
<body>
Student number
</body>
</html>
Chmod 664 /var/vhost/lastname.com/index.html  
4.	Next create the vhost file in your /etc/apache2/sites-available remember the file needs to end in .conf use the domain above {lastname}.com.conf as the filename.
