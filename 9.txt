Apache
What is Apache?
An open source Web Server
Runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
It is considered very secure, fast and reliable
Apache supports several server side scripting languages
Most notably PHP
Apache also supports a variety of mods
Default port is 80 for http and 443 for https
3

Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs)
What is an MPM?
MPMs are used to bind to network ports, accept requests, and
dispatch child processes to handle the requests
Since apache is modular it comes with multiple MPM options, these
are also based on the capability of the operating system
See https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mpm.html for more
detail

apache2
The package and service name on Debian for apache is apache2
Configuration files by default are in:
/etc/apache2/
All configuration files are plain text files
Log files are located in /var/log/apache2/ by default
access_log - contains information about people who access your website
error_log - contains error information about failed attempts to
access your website
5

apache2.conf
By default the document root is in /var/www.html
DocumentRoot /var/www/html - in apache2.conf
By default apache will look for an index.html page to display when
the user navigates to the root of your website
Apache by default blocks all files (includes sub directories):
# Block all by default
<Directory />
AllowOverride none
Require all denied
</Directory>
6

apache2.conf (continued)
You have to allow individual directories:
<Directory "/var/www/html">
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
Require all granted
</Directory>
You can also block specific files:
<Files ".ht*">
Require all denied
</Files>
7

apache2.conf (continued)
You can specify additional optional configuration files with the
IncludeOptional
IncludeOptional sites-available/*.conf
Custom error Documents
ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
8

vhosts (sites)
What are vhosts?
A vhost is a virtual host, this allows you to host multiple
websites on the same server
for example you can host api.example.com and
www.example.com using the same server
you can even host different domains like test.com and
notatest.com
Each vhost will have a separate configuration, and are usually
located in different directories
9

vhost (site) config
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName example2.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/example2.com/html/
ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error_log_ex2
CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access_log_ex1 common
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName example1.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/example1.com/html/
ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error_log_ex1
CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access_log_ex1 common
</VirtualHost>
10

vhost (site) config continued
<Directory /var/www/example2.com/html/>
Require all granted
</Directory>
11

Starting and Stopping
You can use systemd tools to start and stop the apache server
systemctl start apache2 - start the service now
systemctl enable apache2 - have the service start at system
startup
systemctl stop apache2 - stop the service
systemctl restart apache2 - restart the service
systemctl reload apache2 - reload is supported by apache2,
this means it will reload the configuration without stopping the
server
12

apachectl
Apache also comes with its own tool called apachectl
Command Description
apachectl start Start the server
apachectl stop Stop the server
apachectl restart Restart the server
apachectl configtest Test the syntax of the configuration
apachectl status Display a brief status of the server
apachectl fullstsatus Display full status report from mod_status
13

a2enmod and a2dismod
Apache on debian also comes with its own tool for
enabling/disabling modules
a2enmod {module} and a2dismod {module}
Command Description
a2enmod ssl
Enable the ssl module on apache2 by creating
symlinks from mods-available in mods-enabled
a2dismod ssl
Disable the ssl module on apache2 by removing
symlinks from mods-enabled
14

a2ensite and a2dissite
Apache on debian also comes with its own tool for
enabling/disabling sites(vhosts)
a2ensite {site conf} and a2dissite {site conf}
Command Description
a2ensite
iacobacci.com.conf
Enable the iacobacci.com.conf site on apache2
by creating symlinks from sites-available in
sites-enabled
a2dissite
iacobacci.com.conf
Disable the iacobacci.com.conf module on
apache2 by removing symlinks from sitesenabled 
15

a2enconf and a2disconf
Apache on debian also comes with its own tool for
enabling/disabling specific configurations
a2enconf {conf} and a2enconf {conf}
Command Description
a2enconf security.conf
Enable the security.conf site on apache2
by creating symlinks from confavailable in conf-enabled
a2disconf security.conf
Disable the security.conf module on
apache2 by removing symlinks from
conf-enabled 
16

SSL/TLS Support
Apache supports SSL/TLS and HTTPS
First you must enable the SSL mod using apt a2enmod ssl
Next you'll need to obtain a certificate
Then configure you Protocol and Cipher Suites
17

default-ssl.conf and ssl.conf
Setting a certificate (more on getting one later):
SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/iacobacci.ca/fullchain.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/iacobacci.ca/privkey.pem
Set SSL ciphers
SSLProtocol all -SSLv3
SSLCipherSuite EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH
SSLHonorCipherOrder on
18

Certificates
There are 3 ways to get certificates
Generate your own, however this won't be a valid verifiable
certificate, and browsers will warn you the site is insecure
Purchase a certificate
Use a Let's Encrypt certificate
Remember just like SSH, the private certificate MUST remain
secure and private
19

Let's Encrypt
Let's encrypt provides free HTTPS certificates
They have to be renewed about every 3 months
There are some limitations on how many certificates each account
and domain can have
Let's Encrypt does not verify the owner of the certificate outside of
the domain
To get a certificate through Let's Encrypt using the program
certbot is highly recommended
https://certbot.eff.org/
yum install certbot
20

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is the newest version of HTTP
it is a binary protocol rather then plain text (HTTP/1.1)
HTTP/2 support multiple streams simultaneously
Apache has mod_http2 in order to implement HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is not compatible with all MPMs so be careful with your
configuration!
21

PHP
What is PHP?
PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a server side scripting language
These script are executed generally to produce dynamic content
for a website
PHP supports many databases (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, DB2,
Generic ODBC)
Support OOP and structural programming
22

Install and Using PHP
In order to install PHP
apt install php php-mysql libapache2-mod-php
The php packages comes with the required configuration for
apache to read php files. An apache reload will be required.
Once PHP is operation you can then create a script to see your
PHP info
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
23

PHP at runtime
When a PHP file is navigated to, apache will call PHP to run the
script
Since PHP is an interpretive language it will read the file and
interpret with each run (no compilation required)
The script will run as the user the apache server is running as
24

php.ini
The PHP configuration file is located in
/etc/php/{version}/{application}/php.ini
Some of the common configuration changes you might want to edit
include:
upload directory
global variables
max uploading size
max script execution time
25

Firewall
By default Linux comes with a firewall called iptables
iptables has a lot of options:
Including when packets will be analyzed (ex. prerouting,
postrouting, input, output, forward)
how to filter them and what do to with them
However all the options of iptables makes it complicated to use so
instead we use a command called firewalld and firewall-cmd to
configure the basics
firewalld must be installed with apt install firewalld
28

firewall-cmd
Command Description
firewall-cmd --permanent --addport=80/tcp
Open TCP port 80
permanently
firewall-cmd --permanent --addservice=https
Open port(s) for https
permanently
firewall-cmd --permanent --removeport=443/tcp
Closes TCP port 443
permanently
firewall-cmd --reload
Reload the firewall
